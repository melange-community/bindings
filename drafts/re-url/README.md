# re-url

Reason bindings for Javascript's [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) and [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams).

> Note: `URLSearchParams` methods `entries()`, `keys()`, and `values()` current return a `Js.Array.array_like('a)` which you can use with `Js.Array.from` to obtain an array which can be further operated on.
