# Introduction

Fast and efficient immutable collection written in 100% ReScript!

Available packages:
- [Vector](/docs/packages/vector)

TBD:

- [HashMap](/docs/packages/hashmap)
- [HashSet](/docs/packages/hashset)

## Performance

ReScript Collection is aimed at better performance than [Belt](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/belt), the ReScript standard library. And it already significantly outperforms [ImmutableJS](https://immutable-js.com), the most widely used immutable collection in JS.

We have a [performance benchmark](https://reason-seoul.github.io/rescript-collection) against equivalent libraries to make sure the implementation is fast enough.

## Using in JS/TS projects

See [Usage in JavaScript](/docs/javascript)
