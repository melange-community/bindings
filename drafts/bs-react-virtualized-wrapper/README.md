# About

This provides a type-safe set of wrappers (not bindings!) to https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized.

NOTE: This is incredibly incomplete, almost  certainly not idiomatic and to be frank, might be complete and utter garbage. _Here be dragons!_

Again, this is probably slighter better quality than you might expect from 100 monkeys randomly hitting their keyboards.

PRs/bugs with constructive criticism/upgrades are highly appreciated.

# Structure

Each component is a top-level module, and any dependant modules are within that top level module.

Alongside each top level menu there should be a `<Module>Demo.re` demonstrating how to use it.
