## 2.3.11 (2022-11-13)

- Initial support for layout animations with entering and exiting on Text, View, and ScrollView ([davisuga](https://github.com/davisuga)).
- Added support for `rescript-react-native` version `0.70` ([davisuga](https://github.com/davisuga)).

## 2.3.10 (2022-10-05)

### Breaking change

- Renamed the module from `ResAnimated` to `Reanimated`. `Reanimated` should be more appropriate name since this is a binding to react-native-**reanimated** after all.

## 2.3.9 (2022-10-05)

- Added `useAnimatedScrollHandler` and `ScrollView` ([davisuga](https://github.com/davisuga)).

## 2.3.8 (2022-10-03)

- Updated `rescript` to version `10.0.1` ([davisuga](https://github.com/davisuga)).
