# Re-Discord
> A Discord binding library base project implemented in Reason for building your own Discord bot in ReasonML.

## What Is ReasonML 

ReasonML is a programming language designed to give Javascript programmers an easier way to move into Functional Programming. The language provides a lot of tools that many JavaScript developers have wanted out of the box in the language including:
* Currying
* Type Safety
* Immutability
* Typing less types
* Referential Transparency
* and more

This project is meant to give people an introduction to ReasonML through the use of bindings and more so that they can build their own bots in any manner they wish.

All of the code is compiled to JavaScript from ReasonML which will lead to better code type coverage and also prevent many unnecessary run-time errors.
