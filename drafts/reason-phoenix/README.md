# Reason Phoenix

Hello! These are basic ReasonML bindings for the [Phoenix JS library](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/js/). Most of the library already has bindings and I hope to cover the lacking functions ASAP. 

An example can be found [here](https://github.com/celsobonutti/reason-phoenix/blob/master/example/Example.re).
