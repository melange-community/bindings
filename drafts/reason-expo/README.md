## Versioning

This library doesn't follow conventional semver. The version scheme is shown below, and you should track this library accordingly.

`<ExpoVersion>.<Major>.<Minor/Patch>`

## Getting started

Use the Expo CLI to bootstrap a project with the ReasonExpo template.

```
expo init <PROJECT_NAME> --template expo-template-reason
```

Already have an existing Expo Project? Go into your project root & then install the requirements:

```bash
yarn add bs-platform --dev
yarn add reason-react reason-react-native reason-expo
```

Next, create a file named bsconfig.json at the same level at your package.json with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "my-reason-expo-app",
  "reason": {
    "react-jsx": 3
  },
  "bsc-flags": ["-bs-super-errors"],
  "bs-dependencies": ["reason-react", "reason-react-native", "reason-expo"],
  "sources": [
    {
      "dir": "src"
    }
  ],
  "suffix": ".bs.js",
  "refmt": 3,
  "package-specs": {
    "module": "es6",
    "in-source": true
  }
}
```

Next, add these scripts to your package.json:

```json
  "build-reason": "bsb -make-world",
  "watch-reason": "bsb -make-world -w",
  "build-reason-clean": "bsb -clean-world -make-world",
```

Finally, make a folder named `src` and start writing your ReasonML code in there. `yarn build-reason` will compile the ReasonML code in that folder for you to import and use in your Expo app's JS/TS code.

## Contributing

Fork this repo, clone it onto your machine, install run `yarn` in the root directory. Start the compiler and Expo test app with `yarn dev` in the root directory, and start hacking away at the files in `packages/reason-expo` and `packages/test`!
