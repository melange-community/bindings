Good news, maintenance of this bindings have been taken by a new crew. While we

works nicely with
[reason-react 0.7.0](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2019/04/10/react-hooks)
(stay tuned for more soon), we are publishing is a new release that will brings
you some latest things before we start to breaks things a little bit (but donâ€™t
worry we have a migration plan, just because, like everybody, we have to migrate
various codebases).

This release mostly add some missing stuffs, and fixes some.

# v0.10.0 - 2018-09-17

This is the biggest release we have done in a while. It is a result of hard work
done by
[`bs-react-native`](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/graphs/contributors)
and [`rebolt`](https://github.com/callstackincubator/rebolt/graphs/contributors)
teams.

We have worked really hard on bringing you lots of missing components (e.g.
`TouchableNativeFeedback`, `ProgressBarAndroid` and more), improving existing
APIs (e.g. type-safe `Animated` API) and adding documentation to make your
getting started experience even smoother. We hope you will like the changes and
the direction the project is moving! There are many companies looking into
adopting Reason within their existing React & React Native projects right now.
Our focus is to address the use cases and needs of early users to increase the
overall adoption across the ecosystem.

I also would like to thank all contributors that made this project possible. Due
to the complicated nature of merging `rebolt` and `bs-react-native` together,
some of the contribution attributions were lost in the process. Make sure to
check the
[full list our contributors](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
for details.

Meanwhile, see the changelog below for a full list of new features and breaking
changes.

  project's development or have any questions regarding using it in production,
- Improved typing in many modules to be more accurate with what React Native
  expects, including
  [`focus` and `blur` method on `TextInput`](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/fd0ffc78ccc4e86ce9278d7a457db32cb0856dbf),

  [React Native generator](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/bac87534cd78e73ae8f452414fe5fa69b4100202)
  for easier experience getting started,
- Added
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)

## Breaking changes

> All of the breaking changes happened inside `Animated` module. If you are not
> using it, you can safely upgrade and expect little to no changes required.

- `Easing` is now exported as a top-level module,
- `CompositeAnimation` is now an `Animation` module,
- There is no `Timing`, `Spring` and `Decay` module exported at a top-level. Use
  `Animated.timing`, `Animated.spring` and `Animated.decay` instead,
- You no longer need to write `Animated.CompositeAnimation.start`. All methods
  or this module are now available under `Animated` module. For example, you can
  start an animation by writing `Animated.start`. This change aligns the API
  with React Native.

See
[`Animated` guide](https://reasonml-community.github.io/bs-react-native/BsReactNative/AnimatedRe-BsReactNative/)
for details on how to use it.

## What happens with `Rebolt`?

Nothing. Rebolt development will continue under this project umbrella, together,
with the community. We are discussing the `v2` version that plans to deliver
first-class Reason APIs instead of bindings. There are many exciting
opportunities and challenges ahead. If you'd like to get involved, let us know
on Discord (linked above). As soon as any plans or decisions are made, we will
be publishing them here and on Twitter.

# v0.10.0-rc0 - 2018-09-17

Preview of upcoming version with goodies from Rebolt. We are working on
migrating the documentation and last pieces of the information. Meanwhile, feel
free to give this one a go.
