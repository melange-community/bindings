## Guides

### Your first Reason-GraphQL server

**TL;DR;**: This repo has it all with a few interesting things more (such as snapshot testing with jest): https://github.com/rricard/graphql-reason-server-example.

This short guide will show you how to setup a GraphQL server fast.

First, you will need a reason codebase:

```sh
npm install -g bs-platform
bsb -init my-graphql-server -theme basic-reason
cd my-graphql-server
yarn install || npm install
```

Now, you need to install the packages here and graphql as well as express:

```
yarn add graphql express body-parser \
  bs-express bs-graphql bs-apollo-server-express bs-graphql-tools || \
npm install --save graphql express body-parser \
  bs-express bs-graphql bs-apollo-server-express bs-graphql-tools
```
Add the bindings in `bsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-graphql-server",
  "sources": [
    "src"
  ],
  "bs-dependencies" : [
    "bs-express",
    "bs-graphql",
    "bs-graphql-tools",
    "bs-apollo-server-express"
  ]
}
```

We're starting the development, you should run a watch process: `yarn watch || npm run watch`.

Remove `demo.re` and add the following files:

First we'll define a Reason type alongside an associated GraphQL schema and resolver functions: `Episode.re`:

```reason
type t = {
  name: string,
  number: int
};
let hope = {name: "A New Hope", number: 4};
let empire = {name: "The Empire Strikes Back", number: 5};
let jedi = {name: "The Return of the Jedi", number: 6};
let getName e => e.name;
let getNumber e => e.number;
let typeDef = "type Episode { name: String!, number: Int! }";
let resolvers = {"name": getName, "number": getNumber};
```

Then, we'll define the base Query type similarly: `Query.re`:

```reason
let getEpisodes () => [|Episode.hope, Episode.empire, Episode.jedi|];
let getFavoriteEpisode () => Episode.empire;
let typeDef = "type Query { episodes: [Episode!]!, favoriteEpisode: Episode! }";
let resolvers = {"episodes": getEpisodes, "favoriteEpisode": getFavoriteEpisode};
```

We can now put together a schema: `Schema.re`:

```reason
let typeDefs = Query.typeDef ^ " " ^ Episode.typeDef;
let resolvers = {"Query": Query.resolvers, "Episode": Episode.resolvers};
let schema = GraphQLTools.makeExecutableSchema {"typeDefs": typeDefs, "resolvers": resolvers};
```

And finally, we can mount a server: `Server.js`:

```reason
let port = 8080;

external bodyParserJson : unit => Express.Middleware.t = "json" [@@bs.module "body-parser"];

let () = {
  let app = Express.App.make ();
  Express.App.use app (bodyParserJson ());
  let graphqlMiddleware = ApolloServerExpress.createGraphQLExpressMiddleware Schema.schema;
  let graphiqlMiddleware = ApolloServerExpress.createGraphiQLExpressMiddleware "/graphql";
  Express.App.useOnPath app graphqlMiddleware path::"/graphql";
  Express.App.useOnPath app graphiqlMiddleware path::"/graphiql";
  Express.App.listen app ::port;
  Js.log ("GraphQL Server listening on http://localhost:" ^ string_of_int port)
};
```

If your watcher worked so far, you can now run the server and run a query against it:

```sh
node ./lib/js/src/server.js
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"query":"{ favoriteEpisode { name, number }}"}'
```
